# Consultation Meeting Processor — Manual (Placeholder)

**Status:** Source repo could not be cloned in this environment due to network restrictions (HTTP 403 to GitHub). This manual is a placeholder until the real tool content is migrated.

## TODO
- Import the actual tool files (index.html and any assets) from the Consultation-Meeting-Processor repo.
- Verify OAuth/Calendar/OpenAI flows after migration.
- Ensure the "copy index.html" feature fetches `./index.html` inside this folder.
